# Dynamic P2P Network Manager (DyP2PNM)

## Project Description

DyP2PNM is a dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network manager enabling a VPN-like environment. It facilitates robust network connectivity amid changing IPs and network conditions, allows hosting private services, and ensures secure, private intra-network communication.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic IP Management:** Automatically updates and redistributes IP addresses among peers for continuous connectivity.
- **VPN-like Network Overlay:** Creates a private network overlay, enabling secure communication within the P2P network.
- **Selective Service Accessibility:** Hosts internal services like web servers, accessible only within the network.
- **Robust Connection Recovery:** Restores connections efficiently after disruptions or offline periods.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** Offers a decentralized solution for network management, avoiding central servers.
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Ensures communication security within the network, similar to VPNs.

### Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Network Communication:** Python's socket programming, STUN/TURN protocols
- **Security:** TLS/SSL encryption
- **Data Storage:** Local data management for network information
