# NADOO MeshLink

## Project Description
NADOO MeshLink is an advanced Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network management system designed to revolutionize data sharing and connectivity. This dynamic system not only enables robust network connectivity amid changing IP addresses and network conditions but also introduces an innovative approach to decentralized data transfer and resource optimization.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic IP Management:** Seamlessly handles changing IP addresses among peers, ensuring continuous connectivity in a fluid network environment.
- **Localized Data Exchange:** Enables efficient, high-speed data transfer between nearby devices, reducing reliance on internet bandwidth for large file distributions.
- **Distributed Content Delivery:** Optimizes the delivery of large-scale content (e.g., software updates) by leveraging the collective storage and bandwidth of network nodes.
- **Device-to-Device (D2D) Connectivity:** Facilitates direct Wi-Fi connections between devices for localized, high-speed data exchange.
- **VPN-like Network Overlay:** Creates a private, secure network overlay within the P2P network, mirroring VPN functionalities for secure, intra-network communication.
- **Selective Service Accessibility:** Hosts and accesses internal services like web servers exclusively within the network, enhancing privacy and security.
- **Robust Connection Recovery:** Efficiently restores network connections following disruptions or offline periods.
- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** Employs a decentralized approach to network management, eliminating reliance on central servers and enhancing scalability.
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Implements advanced encryption and security protocols to safeguard communications within the network.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Initially using Python, with a planned transition to Mojo for enhanced performance and scalability. This shift will enable running code from all languages supported by ZeroMQ, with efforts to add more language compatibility as needed.
- **Network Communication:** Python's socket programming, STUN/TURN protocols, ZeroMQ for inter-process communications, and libp2p (Go implementation) for the core P2P networking. The transition to Mojo will include adaptations to these communication methods, maintaining and expanding language interoperability.
- **Security:** TLS/SSL encryption, with additional layers of security for D2D communications. Security protocols will be adapted and maintained during the transition to Mojo and the integration of additional programming languages.
- **Data Storage:** Localized data caching and management for efficient content distribution and decentralized storage, with future enhancements in data handling with Mojo and support for multiple programming languages.
