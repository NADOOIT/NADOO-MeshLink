# NADOO MeshLink

## Introduction
NADOO MeshLink is a sophisticated broker process designed to enhance connectivity and data exchange in decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Using Go, it leverages libp2p for robust P2P networking and ZeroMQ for inter-process communication, facilitating seamless interaction across different programming languages.

## Core Functionality
- **Primary Role**: Acts as a broker that listens to user-connected P2P networks and facilitates communication between applications and these networks.
- **Process Lifecycle**: MeshLink runs continuously, monitoring P2P network activity and handling application requests.

## Key Features
1. **P2P Network Communication**
   - *Function*: Manages communication with P2P networks.
   - *Input*: Messages from applications requiring P2P communication.
   - *Output*: Transmission of messages to corresponding P2P partners.
2. **Inter-Process Communication via ZeroMQ**
   - *Function*: Decouples individual processes for language-agnostic communication.
   - *Input*: Requests from applications in different programming languages.
   - *Output*: Coordinated communication with MeshLink and P2P networks.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Go for performance and compatibility with libp2p.
- **Network Communication**: libp2p for P2P networking and ZeroMQ for inter-process communication.

## Architecture
- **Broker Design**: Details MeshLink's architecture as a broker, including handling of P2P connections and application messages.
- **Interoperability**: Explains how ZeroMQ enables MeshLink to interact with applications written in various programming languages.

## Installation and Setup
- **Installation Guide**: Steps for installing MeshLink.
- **Configuration Instructions**: Setting up MeshLink for different P2P networks and application environments.

## Future Directions

#### Mobile Platform Support
- **Integration with iOS and Android**: Creating a Go library from MeshLink for native mobile applications.
- **Using Gomobile**: Building the library with Gomobile for Java/Kotlin (Android) and Swift/Objective-C (iOS) compatibility.
- **Native App Development**: Developing applications that integrate the MeshLink library for mobile P2P communication.
- **Considerations for Mobile**: Adhering to mobile OS limitations, App Store and Google Play Store policies, and optimizing for mobile device performance.

This initiative will expand MeshLink's capabilities to mobile platforms, making it a comprehensive cross-platform solution for decentralized network management.
